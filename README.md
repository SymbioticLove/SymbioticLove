<h1>Introduction</h1>
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! We are Symbiotic Love, a lifestyle brand with a lot of irons in the fire.
My wife is our designer, Jessela. She handles a lot of our store and designs many of our assets.
My name is Matthew, and I am the engineer and administrator for our store, our homepage, and
all of the other projects listed here! You can view my portolio at https://symbioticlove.github.io/Portfolio/. Want your own? Check out https://symbioticlove.github.io/PortfolioPrime/#/PortfolioPrime

<h2>For Potential Employers</h2>
I am currently seeking employment in the engineering field! You can reach out to me at
<a href="mailto:matthew@symbiotic.love?subject=Employment%20Inquiry" alt="Reach out to me">matthew@symbiotic.love</a> with any offers of employment, C2C, 1099 or W2. 
<div>&nbsp</div>
This GitHub profile, while tied into our business, serves as my personal portfolio.
The code is mine and mine alone, across all languages and syntaxes.
<div>&nbsp</div>
I have recently joined HackerRank. These are <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/fordmatthew501?hr_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my certifications</a>.
<div>&nbsp</div>
I feel equally comfortable working with a front-end UX, a REST API, or an e-commerce platform, as well as with system administration.
I am familiar, on a personal level, with Agile methodology.
<div>&nbsp</div>
I have less experience with server-side languages and database engineering. These are a priority to
get familiar and comfortable with.
<div>&nbsp</div>
In the repositories connected to this profile you will find games, React components and projects
like calculators (one in Js and one in Python), as well as our main homepage.
<h2>For Everyone Else</h2>
<h3>We are working on a lot!</h3>
<div>&nbsp</div>
If you are a developer, our React component library is completely open-source
and free for you to use, as are any of our boilerplate templates. These components may not be perfect. They may need to be modified to fit your
specific-use case. If you require any assistance with this, do not hesitate to reach out to us at
<a href="mailto:support@symbiotic.love?subject=Support%20Request" alt="Send Us an Email">support@symbiotic.love.</a>
<div>&nbsp</div>
If you're into reading but always wondered what it would have been like if Harry Potter threw a stick
of butter at his awful uncle, our ongoing project to create the definitive text adventure may interest 
you! You've awakened in a forest. You don't know much else. All the rest is for you to figure out through
choices that create an incredibly fractal story. Each trip to the forest will feel like a new day in a
familiar place, just like real life. The hidden hard-mode and quirky game-overs will keep you thinking
and, we hope, laughing a bit as you piece together a complex underlying and overarching storyline.
The repository containing this project, as well as instructions on downloading and playing it can be
found by visiting https://github.com/SymbioticLove/Mother.
<div>&nbsp</div>
Most of the other small projects are here for employers, but some are functional nonetheless! Technically,
any of these projects will function with the proper set-up, some simply haven't been packaged in their
final form either to keep the code from being compressed or to allow them to be hosted on GitHub Pages. If
you do find a need for a packaged version of anything here, you may reach out to <a href="mailto:support@symbiotic.love?subject=Support%20Request" alt="Send Us an Email">support@symbiotic.love</a> and we can take care of that for you!
